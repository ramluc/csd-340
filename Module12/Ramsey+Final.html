                    <div class="card-content">
                        I am a huge fan of reading. I think that it helps a lot when trying to see other persepectives on life and people's experinces.
                        I personally love reading light novels, manga, and storybooks. I think that these readings are not only entertaining but are 
                        able to allow me insight. I see why people decide their actions and why they act in contradictory ways.

                    <div class="card-content">
                        Much like other young people, I like playing video games. I play mostly Don't Starve Together, Risk of Rain 2, and MineCraft. I 
                        personally like being able to make choices and build up a base in my own way. Also the whole killing hordes of stuff,as I am a guy.

                    <div class="card-content">
                        I love watching other people's reactions and interactions with eachother and their enviornment. I think that people can interacte 
                        with eachother in diffrent ways than they would in person. This can also be seen in roleplay. Not that kind. I mean more so like 
                        the dream smp. It is a interesting minecraft story.

                        This was my Dad's friend's business. I was generally working during the summertime. I would often help to set up the bouncey castles
                        and setting up the rock climb or mini golf course. I remember hating trying to get out all the air from the houses. They really sucked, 
                        and it needed all the air out to even possibly let it fit back in the holders.

                        This is actually where I am working now. I started this as an internship in High School. It is a production seller on Amazon. I started
                        out by working on code. I think that it was actually a date setter in google scripts that I first made there. I was then later moved onto 
                        charging the cameras, then moved off IT to Training and Candy Room. I miss the IT.

                        I like the idea of work ethics. I personally have great work ethic.For example, I don't mind staying behind to clean, help new people learn 
                        about the rules and producers. However, I believe that work ethic relies on the bosses as well. For example, thanking the person staying late
                        or even helping them. Now, the reason I bring this up is due to my loss in Work ethic. I was told ,after a conflict with morning crew's 
                        cleaning, that staying late was on me. Now, does my work ethic mean I should stay late or does my ethic demand that I show my worth by not 
                        staying?

    <p>Flo was born May 28,1945 to Fred and Virgina Coberley. She was the younger sibling of Robert, her brother. She was also the last child her parents had. Her younger life was full of fun memories. One such example of this was her summer vacations. The family went down to Wisconsin, often going fishing and playing cards. One example for a card game was Crazy Rummy..However her friends were often around and did many activities together. She actually met her future husband due to this. They met at a picnic she was having with her friends. She loved being outdoors and exercising. One example of this was how her favorite subject was gym. It was an easy and fun time to hang out with friends and classmates. It did not require books or homework, (the bane of any school child). Of course after finishing high school, she decided to start a family, instead of going to college.  She proceeded to have multiple kids, here they are in order,Christine,Kim,Eric,Jenny,Heather,Andy,Larry,Laura. The final two (Larry and Laura) were fraternal twins. She then, unfortunately lost her husband. This made raising her childer still living with her much harder but she persevered. Until she raised them all to who they are now. Her best achievement, a great and loving family. Since she semi-retired she took up sewing, and gardening. These pastimes led to crocheting and canning. Even now she makes blankets and sleep pants for her grandchildren. She still enjoys walking her mastiff and hanging out with her great-grandson even at the age of 76.</p>
